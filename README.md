# üí≥ Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

This project builds a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a real-world anonymized dataset. It handles severe class imbalance, performs detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA), and applies classification models to identify fraud effectively.

---

## üìÅ Dataset

- **File**: `bank.csv`
- **Source**: Provided dataset (assumed to be a modified credit card dataset)
- **Size**: Contains transaction records with labeled outputs indicating fraud or not.
- **Note**: Features may be anonymized or encoded for confidentiality.

---

 Objectives

- Detect fraudulent credit card transactions.
- Handle data imbalance in a binary classification setting.
- Evaluate model performance using metrics beyond simple accuracy.
- Optionally deploy a simple prediction interface.

---

 Features

- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Visual EDA (class distribution, correlation, outlier analysis)
- Model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
- Optional deployment using Flask or Streamlit
